A sensor for getting information about the next time Hjem-Is comes to visit. 
It will automatically pull your coordinates from HA (if set).
If not set you can set it manually.
You give it coordinates and it will list the closest stop for you to choose from.
You can add multiple stops if you want to.

After installing the integration using HACS and restarting your server you simply add a Hjem-Is stop by clicking the button below or by going to Devices & Services and adding it from there.
